1. Retrieve Product Information: 
  • Write a query to fetch the names and descriptions of all products. 
      SELECT productName, productDescription, productAttributes
      FROM products;
  
  • Extend the previous query to include specific attributes such as color, size, and price. 
      SELECT  name, description, 
      JSON_UNQUOTE(JSON_EXTRACT (attributes, '$.color')) AS color,
      JSON_UNQUOTE(JSON_EXTRACT (attributes, '$.size')) AS size,
      JSON_EXTRACT(attributes, '$.price') 
      AS price
      FROM products;


2. Query Orders and Order Details: 
  •Retrieve the details of all orders placed, including the order date, customer ID, product name, quantity, and price. 
      SELECT o.order_id,  o.order_date, o.customer_id, p.name AS product_name od.quantity  od.price
      FROM orders o
      JOINord er_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
      JOINproducts p ON od.product_id = p.product_id;
  
  •Calculate the total cost of each order. 
      SELECT o.order_id,
       SUM(od.quantity * od.price) AS total_cost
      FROM orders o
      JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
      GROUP BY o.order_id;

      
3.Filtering Products Based on Attributes: 
  •Write a query to find all products with a price greater than $50. 
      SELECT name,attributes
      FROM products
      WHERE JSON_EXTRACT(attributes, '$.price') > 50;
  
  •Filter products by color and brand, and display their names and prices. 
      SELECT name, JSON_EXTRACT(attributes, '$.price') AS price
      FROM products
      WHERE JSON_EXTRACT(attributes, '$.color') = 'maroon' 
      AND JSON_EXTRACT(attributes, '$.brand') = 'VonRueden Group';


4. Calculating Aggregate Data: 
   • Calculate the total sales revenue generated by each product. 
       SELECT p.product_id, p.name,
       SUM(od.quantity * od.price)
       AS    total_sales_revenue
       FROM products p
       JOIN order_details od ON p.product_id = od.product_id
       GROUP BY p.product_id, p.name;
   
  • Determine the total quantity of each product ordered. 
      SELECT p.product_id, p.name,
      SUM(od.quantity) AS total_ordered_quantity
      FROM products p
      JOIN order_details od ON p.product_id = od.product_id
      GROUP BY p.product_id, p.name;


5. Advanced Filtering and Aggregation: 
  • Find the top 5 best-selling products based on total quantity sold. 
      SELECT p.product_id, p.name,
      SUM(od.quantity) AS total_quantity_sold
      FROM products p
      JOIN order_details od ON p.product_id = od.product_id
      GROUP BY p.product_id, p.name
      ORDER BY total_quantity_sold DESC
      LIMIT 5;
  
  • Identify the average price of products from a specific brand. 
      SELECT JSON_UNQUOTE (JSON_EXTRACT(attributes, '$.brand')) AS brand, AVG(JSON_EXTRACT(attributes, '$.price')) 
      AS average_price
      FROM  products
      WHERE  JSON_UNQUOTE (JSON_EXTRACT(attributes, '$.brand'))  =  'Schmitt, Turcotte and Cruickshank';
  

6.	Nested JSON Queries: 
  •	Retrieve the color and size of a specific product.
      SELECT JSON_UNQUOTE(JSON_EXTRACT  (attributes, '$.color')) AS color, JSON_UNQUOTE(JSON_EXTRACT(attributes, '$.size')) AS size
      FROM products
      WHERE product_id = 5;
   
  •Extract and display all available attributes of products in JSON format. 
      SELECTname,  description,  attributes
      FROM products;


7. Joining Multiple Tables: 
  • Write a query to find all orders placed by customers along with the products ordered and their quantities. 
      SELECT o.order_id,  o.customer_id,  p.name AS product_name,  od.quantity
      FROM orders o
      JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
      JOIN products p ON od.product_id = p.product_id;
   
  •Calculate the total revenue generated by each customer. 
      SELECT o.customer_id,
      SUM(od.quantity * od.price) AS total_revenue
      FROM orders o
      JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
      GROUP BY o.customer_id;


8. Data Manipulation with JSON Functions: 
  • Update the price of a specific product stored as JSON attribute. 
      SELECT * FROM `products` WHERE product_id =1;
      UPDATE products
      SET attributes = JSON_SET(attributes, '$.price', 'new_price')
      WHERE product_id = 1;
  
  • Add a new attribute to all products with a default value. 
      ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN weight VARCHAR(255)
      DEFAULT 'default_value';




9.Advanced JSON Operations: 
  • Find products with specific attributes that match a given criteria using JSON path expressions. 
      SELECT * FROM products 
      WHERE JSON_EXTRACT(attributes, '$.color') ='maroon' AND
      JSON_EXTRACT(attributes, '$.brand') ='VonRueden Group';
  
  • Extract and display the first element of an array stored within a JSON attribute. 
      SELECT JSON_EXTRACT(attributes, '$.features[0]') 
      AS first_feature
       FROM products;
